<b>Task: Interaction Extraction between two biomedical entities</b>

My primary focus is trying to extract a relationship tuple and to present the relation along a structure similar to Predicate logic. 

For example, </br>
a predicate logic composite like, activate(X, Y)

Specific example: </br>
NS5A activate PI3K = <b>activate</b>(NSSA, PI3K)

With this construction, I am trying to build a GNN using PyNeuraLogic (or other libraries that provide similar functions) that enables logical deduction from facts.
